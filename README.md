# My thesis defence talk on December 20, 2019
* About: It concenrates mainly on explaining the BV-formalism for IBL-infinity algebras and how it is (formally) related to path integration. The goal was to show a little bit of modern physics to mathematicians. I also mention the vanishing result and formulate a formality conjecture. See my [phd-thesis](https://github.com/p135246/phd-thesis) for other results and theory.
